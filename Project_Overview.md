# Project Overview — Modeling TF Activation in Müller Glia

## Biological Goal
Model how transcription factors (TFs) becomes activated in Müller glia (MG) and identify small molecules that mimic these signals to transform MG into rod photoreceptor–like cells. 

## Success Criteria
1. Identify MG-to-rod transition signatures using TF activity modeling.
2. Find gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that highlight key TFs.
3. Screen small molecules that reproduce same TF activation patterns.

## Planned Outputs
- Figures showing TF activity maps (UMAP plots)
- Ranked list of compounds that mimic TF-driven signatures
- Create reproducible Jupyter notebooks
